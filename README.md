This is a claw machine where the claw is actually a cat! It will be pretty big, 2x2x2 feet plus some area at the bottom for the prize hole and controls.

Why did I make this? Every year my school has a craft fair and I never sell much ;-; I was wondering "how am I supposed to sell stuff if everyone is making the _same exact thing_ as me??" Well I was already ok in hardware so I decided to make a claw machine!! :D
