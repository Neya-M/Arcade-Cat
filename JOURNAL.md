# June 4th: Sketched the motor system

I made a sketch of where the motors would go so I have an idea of how it will work (oh no its low quality ðŸ˜­)

# July 21st: completed the diagrams of motor systems

I finally finished the other YSWSes so I have time for this, here are some much more detailed (yet still very scrappy) sketches of my motor system:

<img width="265" height="265" alt="Untitled 24" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d99646e8-1435-4270-8319-688a45214742" />

This is a diagram of where the x, y, and z axes are.

The left side of the y axis is a gear rack. a gear (red) on a stepper motor (blue) uses this to move the x axis forward and backward. The other side of the y axis is an aluminum extrusion (green), which supports the x axis while still letting it slide back and forth.

The x axis is a wooden board with a slot cut out of it. This slot lets the cord of the z axis (not shown) through. It is attatched to the stepper motor from the previous image so it can move along the y axis. There is another stepper motor (blue) on the x axis that also uses a gear and rack to move along t
he x axis. This stepper is glued to the z controls as shown in the next images.

<img width="265" height="265" alt="Untitled 30" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2da832b7-b7b3-4cdf-904f-93db70e61c18" />

This is the z axis. it is a spool with a cord (purple) that moves the claw up and down. It uses a servo to turn the spool, and if more revolutions are needed, I can add a gear box. This servo is connected to the x axis stepper motor that moves it left and right.

The claw is a cat that picks up prizes with its paws. Servo #2 turns a screw-like system (shown in purple and pink) which moves it up, closing the claw as shown in the diagram.
