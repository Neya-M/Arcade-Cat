Body is completely my design
Back_leg and Front_leg are my design except the connector on top
Screw1 is based on someone else's design
Screw2 is not my design but was modified a lot by me (shorter, longer connectors, wider thread)
Screw_case is not my design but was modified a bit by me (thicker connectors
all above design parts that aren't mine were made by Ryan (Jules) on slack (who got banned but idk why)

There's also the Gear and Rack, which were designed by Extrusionist on thingiverse:https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3444515

Firmware was by me with AI help
Electronic parts/BOM, Wiring, JOURNAL, and README by me
